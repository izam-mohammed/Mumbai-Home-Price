In this end-to-end data science and machine learning project 🔥, I Build a model that predicts the price of houses in Mumbai 💡. After Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation, I found that a Linear Regression is best for this model. The Model has 87% of accuracy in predicting house prices 💥. The dataset used is the Mumbai prices data set from Kaggle. 🌚
